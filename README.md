## Introduction 

The pub is a wonderous place, where one can enjoy a meal and an imbibement or three with friends & family. It is also a British tradition to boot. So I have created a Pub application that will produce a round of drinks and show th price.  

### Objective 

The main objective of this Project is to create an automated application that takes 4 services working in conjunction with one another. Service 1 can be considered to be the front-end or user-facing side of the app. Services 2 and 3 will each produce an item in my scenario, one alcholic drink and one soft drink. Finally service 4 will take the information on board and collate it whilst producing a price for the total. 


### Proposal 

As an avid Pub frequenter, I would enjoy the idea of an app detailing how much my round will be. So, I know that other Pub-goers would enjoy such an app to make interactions seamless. The following is an epic, (a colection of User Stories that make up the cor requiremnets of the app).

- As an app user I want to be able to view my round so that I know how much to pay
- As an app user I want to know what I have in my round so that I know what I am drinking  
- As an app user I want to create a custom order so that I can have a custom round 
- As an app user I want to be able to change my order so that I can add my favourite drinks 
- As an app user I want to be able to cancel my order as I may no longer want it
